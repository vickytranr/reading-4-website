        <p>A Internet is a galaxy. <br> A website is a spaceship.</p>
        <p>Much like a website, a spaceship can be a personal space that you completely control yourself, or it can be run by a team and be a collaborative space.</p>
        <p>The purpose of a spaceship will depend on how you view one and the uses it can have, like how a can be a mode of transportation versus a place that you return to once youâ€™ve explored a planet - in this way, a website can be a way to navigate to other links, as an archive of content, or as a constantly changing thing.</p>
